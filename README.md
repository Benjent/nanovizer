## Requirements
- Python 3
- flask 2
- flask_cors 3
- npm

## Using NanoVizer for the first time

1. Setup the project

```sh
npm install
```

2. Follow the steps in the *Running NanoVizer* section

## Running NanoVIzer

1. Run the project

    * Using the vanilla method

        1. Run the backend in a terminal

            ```sh
            app.py
            ```

        2. Run the frontend in another terminal

            ```sh
            npm run dev
            ```

    * Using the custom method

        ```sh
        TODO commande de Corentin
        ```

2. Open a browser tab and go to the following URL

```sh
http://localhost:3000/
```

3. Put the .bam file in the TODO folder

## Why not using a serverless app?
- This project is intended to run for free
- .bam files are too heavy to manipulate for free
- It is faster to move .bam files in a local directory compared to uploading them in the cloud
